github-backup (1.20160522) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Work around git weirdness in handling of relative path to GIT_INDEX_FILE
    when in a subdirectory of the repository.
  * Various updates to internal git and utility libraries shared
    with git-annex.
  * debian: Add lintian overrides for rpath.
  * debian: Bump standards-version.
  * Makefile: Pass LDFLAGS, CFLAGS, and CPPFLAGS through ghc and on to 
    ld, cc, and cpp. This lets the Debian package build with various
    hardening options. Although their benefit to a largely haskell program
    is unknown.
